LINGR — Ambient Horror Presence App

I am building a mobile app called LINGR, an ambient, presence-based horror experience. It is not a traditional app you open — it behaves like a subtle haunting that lives throughout the user's device. The entire product is built around atmosphere, minimalism, unpredictability, and consent-driven interactions.

Please scaffold the project accordingly.

What LINGR Is

LINGR creates the illusion that a supernatural “presence” has attached itself to the user’s phone. Instead of jump scares, the app focuses on dread, subtlety, and environmental ambience through device-level interactions.

The app communicates through:

eerie push notifications

unsettling haptic patterns

brief ringtone flickers

cryptic messages

momentary icon appearances

optional AR “presence detection” events

behavior that adapts to user location (home vs. public)

voice-activated summoning (“Hey Lingr… are you here?”)

Everything must be opt-in, with visible controls to pause, disable, or remove the “presence.”

Core UI/UX Principles

Minimalist, atmospheric interface

Dark, liminal, slightly analog-distorted aesthetic

Animations that feel “alive” and unpredictable

Interface should resemble a paranormal investigation tool, not a normal app

A single “Entity Profile” page that evolves as the haunting deepens

An “Evidence Locker” where captured AR moments, messages, and anomalies are stored

A “Presence Detector” camera screen (for AR flashes)

A Control Center with explicit consent toggles

Everything should feel quiet, unnerving, and narratively cohesive

Primary Features for the Initial Build

Please prepare the project structure so we can gradually build the following:

Push notification engine

Randomized event scheduler (for subtle scares)

Basic AR camera screen (placeholder, no 3D assets yet)

Minimal UI including:

Home (the “Presence”)

Evidence Locker

Presence Detector (AR)

Settings/Consent Center

Voice trigger stubs

GPS-based behavioral flagging (stub)

A simple entity system (one default entity)

Placeholder screens for episodic content

Technical Expectations

Create a clean, scalable project with modern best practices

Modular architecture so entities, events, and scares can be added easily

Use whatever Replit recommends for multi-platform mobile (e.g., React Native Expo or Flutter)

Include a configuration file where we can later define scare types, weights, timing, and triggers

End Goal of This Session

Generate a full starter project for LINGR with:

file structure

placeholder screens

sample components

routing

mock services for notifications, AR, and events

dark atmospheric theme

and a README outlining how each system will later be implemented.
