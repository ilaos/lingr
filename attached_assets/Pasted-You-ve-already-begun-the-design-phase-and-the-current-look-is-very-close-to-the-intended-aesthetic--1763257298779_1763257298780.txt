You’ve already begun the design phase and the current look is very close to the intended aesthetic. Let’s refine and expand the design intention so future iterations stay aligned.

Overall Creative Direction

LINGR is an ambient haunting on the user’s phone.
The UI must feel like:

a presence is watching, shifting, or evolving

every screen is part of the same supernatural “entity”

atmospheric > decorative

clean and minimal > horror cliché

Keep the current style:
Dark charcoal backgrounds, ethereal purple accents (#8B7FF5), subtle glow, film-grain texture, slow pulses, smooth spring animations.

Screen Behavior Expectations
1. Presence Screen (Home)

This is the “heart” of the haunting.
The user should feel like the entity is always just behind the screen.

Enhance it with:

subtle idle motions in the entity image (drift, distortion, shimmer)

ambient background grain or micro glints

intensity meter that shifts slowly on its own

cryptic messages that change over time based on entity “mood”

The user should feel watched but in a quiet, unsettling way.

2. Evidence Locker

You started this perfectly.

Enhance by:

adding category filters (All / AR / Audio / Messages)

a “void” animation when empty (soft floating particles)

each entry having timestamps + type tags

item click → opens “case file” modal with eerie framing

3. Detector Screen (AR Mode)

This should feel like a paranormal investigation tool.

Enhance with:

scanning lines slowly sweeping

distortion near the reticle

flicker animations when “presence detected”

a “capture log” event entry added to Evidence Locker

Keep everything subtle and not cartoonish.

4. Control Center

This is the user’s safety hub.

Enhance with:

an “Entity Status” section showing:

Mood

Intensity

Recent activity

toggles grouped elegantly under:

Ambient

Visual

Audio

Location

AR

a Pause Haunting button that triggers a calm, eerie dissolution animation

double confirmation for “Remove Presence”

Design System Adjustments

Please solidify the following in your design system:

Typography:

Title: Inter or SF with slightly reduced tracking

Secondary: a monospace for timestamps, data streams

Icons:

Simple outline glyphs with faint glow

Shadows:

Ultra soft, atmospheric, not “material design” drops

Animations:

Slow ease-in-out, delayed jitter, pulsation

No harsh entrance animations

Important: Keep All Existing Screens

Do not replace or restart the UI.
Continue evolving what you’ve built with these updated guidelines.

Immediate Next Steps

Add the missing screen: Episodes / Haunts Hub

A mysterious list of “Haunt chapters”

Cards that look like locked files, with one available in prototype

Add entity mood logic stubs (just UI for now)

Add presence-driven micro-interactions across all tabs

Add a subtle animated background layer app-wide

Long-term Goal

Build LINGR as a cohesive horror presence with:

persistent entity behavior

evidence collection

ambient scares

AR flashes

episodic content

consent-driven settings

evolving entity persona
