Phase 2 is perfect. The presence logic feels alive — mood, intensity, messages, evidence, episodes.

For Phase 3, do NOT change the visual design system.
Keep all existing screens, styles, and animations.

Now we focus on making the Detector screen actually feel like a camera-based AR haunting with real evidence capture.

1. Replace Fake Background With Live Camera Feed

On the Detector screen:

Use the appropriate Expo/React Native camera component to show a live camera feed behind the existing UI overlays.

Keep:

reticle

scan lines

status text

capture button

atmospheric effects (flicker, warnings)

Make sure:

camera permission is requested in a consentful way

if permission is denied, show a clean “Camera unavailable” state with explanation rather than breaking

The look should still match the current aesthetic: dark overlays, subtle glow, slow animation.

2. Apparition Flash System (Visual Only)

Create a lightweight “apparition flash” system:

When user is scanning (Detector open), occasionally trigger an apparition event:

A barely-visible silhouette or glitch overlay appears for 100–400 ms

It should be subtle and easy to miss

Use a purple-tinted, noisy silhouette or glitch image layered over the camera, with low opacity and quick fade

Apparitions should:

Appear more often when entity intensity is high

Almost never appear when the entity is Dormant

Never loop constantly; they must feel rare and surprising

Apparitions = pure front-end visuals for now — no real-world mapping needed.

3. Evidence Capture Integration

Tie the Detector into the evidence system built in Phase 2:

When:

user taps the Capture button OR

an apparition event occurs

Create an evidence entry via the existing evidence API:

type: "AR_CAPTURE" or "ANOMALY"

timestamp: now

description: pick from the existing AR/Anomaly description pools

optional field: source: "detector"

The Evidence Locker should immediately show these new items.

Also:

Add a small toast or micro-feedback on capture like:

“Anomaly recorded.”

“Trace logged.”

This should be subtle, not game-y.

4. Detector → Entity Interaction

Make the Detector feel like it affects the entity:

When the user spends time scanning:

Slight chance to increase intensity

Slight chance to shift mood upward (e.g., Dormant → Restless / Restless → Active)

When the user captures evidence:

Trigger a small intensity spike

Optionally log an internal “interaction count” for later use (e.g., unlock episodes)

All of this should plug into the existing Phase 2 engine:

use entityEngine + eventsScheduler instead of duplicating logic.

5. Controls & Safety

In the Control / Settings screen, add:

A toggle: “Allow camera manifestations”

When off:

Detector uses a static dark background or subtle animation instead of camera

Apparitions do not show

But the rest of the app remains functional

Keep language calm and clear:

No guilt-tripping for disabling AR.

6. Dev / Debug Tools for Detector (Non-user Facing)

For development only (can be behind a constant flag):

Add a hidden “Force Apparition” button or gesture:

Instantly triggers an apparition overlay and an AR_CAPTURE evidence entry

Optionally log apparition triggers in the console for validation

This will help test the system without waiting for random probability.

7. What NOT to Implement Yet

To keep scope clean, do NOT implement:

True world-anchored AR (planes, depth, SLAM, etc.)

3D models

External storage for captured frames

Background camera use when app is closed

Any real face recognition or environment analysis

All apparitions should be simple overlay effects for now.

8. Completion Checklist for Phase 3

Phase 3 is complete when:

Detector uses a real camera feed (with graceful fallback when denied)

Apparitions can appear randomly while scanning (intensity-weighted)

User can tap Capture to log evidence entries

Evidence Locker displays Detector evidence

Detector activity slightly influences mood/intensity

“Allow camera manifestations” toggle works and disables visual AR behavior

Once Phase 3 is done, I’ll give direction for Phase 4 – Ambient Notification Scares & Schedules, using the existing eventsScheduler as the backbone.
