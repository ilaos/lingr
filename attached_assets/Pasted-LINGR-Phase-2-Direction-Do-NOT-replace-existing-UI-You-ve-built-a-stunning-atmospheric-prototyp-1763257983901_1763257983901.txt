LINGR – Phase 2 Direction (Do NOT replace existing UI)

You’ve built a stunning atmospheric prototype. The current UI style, animations, and presence-driven behaviors are perfect. Let’s move into Phase 2, which focuses on deepening the logic layer while preserving the aesthetic.

Important Rules

Do not redesign or restyle the current screens.

Do not replace existing animations or components.

Add depth, subtlety, and logic beneath what exists.

Keep everything quiet, eerie, and minimal.

Phase 2 Goals
1. Entity Behavior Engine (Stub Only)

Create an internal entityEngine.ts including:

mood progression logic (Dormant → Restless → Active → Agitated)

intensity fluctuation rules

“cooldown” periods where intensity lowers

timers that shift mood at irregular intervals

a placeholder “entity personality” system

No backend needed yet — just simulated behaviors.

2. Cryptic Message System (Expanded)

We need a structured message system, not hardcoded text.

Create a messages.ts module with:

message pools per mood

weighted randomness

cooldowns between repeats

“rare messages” with <5% chance

ability to later add location-based messages

Integrate this into the Presence screen so messages feel alive.

3. Episodes Data Layer (Stub Only)

Convert the Haunts tab from static UI to data-driven:

Create episodes.ts with:

episode id

title

description

locked/unlocked state

optional “teaser” text

“rarity” for future supernatural interactions

placeholder array of 5–8 episodes

The UI should read from this dataset.

4. Evidence Locker Data Model (Stub Only)

Add a very light simulated data layer:

In evidence.ts:

define evidence types (AR, message, anomaly)

structure for timestamp, type, description, id

a simple addEvidence() function

a simple getEvidence() function

Update the Evidence Locker UI to use these instead of dummy placeholders.

5. Event Scheduler (Basic Simulation)

Create a module: eventsScheduler.ts

simulate random “presence events”

every X to Y seconds, generate:

intensity changes

mood shifts

evidence entries

cryptic message refresh

use randomized intervals (e.g., 20–60 seconds)

This should plug into the existing UI and feel like the entity is “alive.”

What NOT To Build Yet

To keep the project clean and in control, do NOT implement:

real AR capture

real notifications

GPS-based behavior

microphone input

background services

external databases

login or user accounts

These will come later.

Final Output for This Phase

The UI should behave exactly the same, but:

moods feel more dynamic

cryptic messages change based on logic

episodes load from data

evidence locker fills with generated anomalies

entity feels interactive and reactive

the presence feels “aware” over time

Let me know once Phase 2 is complete so I can direct Phase 3 (AR Scare Pipeline).
